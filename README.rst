What this is
============

The sword push web client is a Pyramid webapp designed to let a user upload a MS Word or OpenOffice document, do a conversion to CNXML, and push it to the cnx.org site as a module, using the sword v2 interface. It will be generalised to enable pushing to any sword-compliant service.

Quick Start
===========

Since this is still in development, and depends on lots of in-development packages, I recommend that you install it via the following buildout:

Instructions are in that readme.
